# Testing the Crypto Dashboard

## Current Issues Fixed

### 1. Chart API Rate Limiting (401 Errors)

**Problem**: Charts showing "Chart unavailable HTTP error! status: 401" due to CoinGecko API rate limits.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced error handling in `src/lib/api.ts` with better error messages
- Improved UI in `src/components/PriceChart.tsx` with user-friendly error display
- Added retry functionality and better error classification

### 2. Error Handling Improvements

**Changes Made**:
- `fetchWithErrorHandling` function now provides specific messages for 401/429 errors
- PriceChart component shows yellow warning instead of red error for temporary issues
- Added "Try Again" button that refreshes the page

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Basic Dashboard
1. Open http://localhost:3002
2. Verify coin list loads correctly
3. Check that prices update hourly (you can wait or manually refresh)
4. Test watchlist functionality (add/remove coins)

### 2. Test Chart Functionality
1. Click on any coin to go to detail page
2. Check if chart loads successfully
3. If you see "Chart temporarily unavailable":
   - This is expected due to API rate limits
   - Click "Try Again" button
   - Wait a few minutes and refresh

### 3. Test API Rate Limiting Behavior
1. Rapidly navigate between multiple coin detail pages
2. You should see graceful error handling instead of crashes
3. Error messages should be informative and user-friendly

## Expected Behavior

### When API Works Normally
- Charts display 7-day price history
- Interactive tooltips show exact prices and dates
- Price change indicators show green/red based on performance

### When API Rate Limited
- Yellow warning message appears instead of chart
- Clear explanation about temporary restriction
- "Try Again" button allows easy retry
- Application remains functional for other features

## Rate Limiting Context

CoinGecko's free API has these limits:
- 30 calls/minute for public API
- Chart endpoint (`market_chart`) is separate from main markets endpoint
- Rate limits reset after a few minutes

## Fallback Strategy

The current implementation:
1. Tries to load full chart data
2. On failure, shows informative error message
3. Maintains application stability
4. Allows easy retry without full page reload

## Next Steps for Production

1. Consider CoinGecko Pro API for higher limits
2. Implement client-side caching for chart data
3. Add chart data prefetching for popular coins
4. Consider alternative data sources for redundancy
